        <h1>My Dream</h1>
        <p>
            When you need a way to beat the pressure down<br>
            When you need to find a way to breathe<br>
            I could be the one to make you feel that way<br>
            I could be the one to set you free<br>
            If you wanna see me when the crowd is gone<br>
            It used to be so easy, can't you see?<br>
            I could be the one to make you feel that way<br>
            I could be the one to set you free
